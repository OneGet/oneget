# PackageManagement (aka OneGet)


### What's New
PackageManagement is supported in Windows, Linux and MacOS now.
We periodically make binary drops to [PowerShellCore][pscore],
meaning PackageManagement is a part of PowerShell Core releases.
Also PackageManagement and PowershellGet Modules are regularly updated in [PowerShellGallery.com](https://www.PowerShellGallery.com).

Thus check out the latest version from PowerShellGallery.com.

[pscore]: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell

### Get Started!

OneGet is shipped in Win10 and Windows Server 2016! For downlevel OS, you can install the [WMF 5.0 RTM][WMF5.0] or [WMF5.1 Preview][WMF5.1] and then start using the OneGet.

You can follow [@PSOneGet on Twitter](http://twitter.com/PSOneGet) to be notified of every new build.

### What is PackageManagement (OneGet)?

OneGet is a Windows package manager, renamed as PackageManagement. It is a unified interface to package management systems and aims to make Software Discovery, Installation, and Inventory (SDII) work via a common set of cmdlets (and eventually a set of APIs). Regardless of the installation technology underneath, users can use these common cmdlets to install/uninstall packages, add/remove/query package repositories, and query a system for the software installed.

With OneGet, you can
* Manage a list of software repositories in which packages can be searched, acquired, and installed
* Search and filter your repositories to find the packages you need
* Seamlessly install and uninstall packages from one or more repositories with a single PowerShell command

### Let's Try it

#### Prerequisites
 - Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, or down-level Windows OS + WMF5
 - Linux or Mac with the [PowerShellCore][pscore]


#### Working with PowerShellGallery.com

 ```powershell
 # 1.check available providers

 PS E:\> get-packageprovider

Name                     Version          DynamicOptions

# 2. find a module from the PowerShell gallery, for example, xjea

PS E:\> find-module xjea

NuGet provider is required to continue
PowerShellGet requires NuGet provider version '2.8.5.201' or newer to interact with NuGet-based repositories. The NuGet provider must be available in 'C:\Program
Files\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies' or 'C:\Users\jianyunt\AppData\Local\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies'. You can also install the NuGet provider by
running 'Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -MinimumVersion 2.8.5.201 -Force'. Do you want PowerShellGet to install and import the NuGet provider now?

#### Working with http://www.NuGet.org repository

```

### Try the latest PackageManagement (OneGet)

You can run `install-module PowerShellGet` to install the latest PackageManagment and PowerShellGet from [PowerShellGallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com).

### Downloading the Source Code
OneGet repo has a number of other repositories embeded as submodules. To make things easy, you can just clone recursively:
```powershell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/OneGet/oneget.git
```
If you already cloned but forgot to use `--recursive`, you can update submodules manually:
```powershell
git submodule update --init
```

### Building the code

``` powershell
# After cloning this repository, go to the project folder:
> cd oneget
> cd src

# download the dotnet cli tool
> .\bootstrap.ps1

# building OneGet for fullclr
> .\build.ps1 net452

#building OneGet for coreclr
> .\build.ps1 netstandard1.6
> .\build.ps1 netcoreapp2.0
```

If successfully built above, you should be able to see a folder:
`oneget\src\out\PackageManagement\` whose layout looks like below:

 * `coreclr`
 * `fullclr`
 * `PackageManagement.format.ps1xml`
 * `PackageManagement.psd1`
 * `PackageManagement.psm1`
 * `PackageProviderFunctions.psm1`

### Deploying it

#### Generate PackageManagement.nupkg
We can use `publish-module` to create a .nupkg. Assuming you want to put the generated .nupkg in c:\test folder.  You can do something like below. Note I cloned to E:\OneGet folder.
 ```powershell
cd E:\OneGet\oneget\src\out\PackageManagement
Register-PSRepository -name local -SourceLocation c:\test
Get-PSRepository
Publish-Module -path .\ -Repository local
PS E:\OneGet\oneget\src\out\PackageManagement> dir c:\test\PackageManagement*.nupkg

    Directory: C:\test


Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                -------------         ------ ----
-a----        11/4/2016   4:15 PM        1626335 PackageManagement.1.1.0.0.nupkg
```
Then you can do
```powershell
find-module -Repository local
install-module -Repository local -Name PackageManagement
```
to get the newly built PackageManagement on your machines.

#### Manual copy
You can also manually copy the OneGet binaries. For example, copy the entire `E:\OneGet\oneget\src\out\PackageManagement` folder you just built to your
`$env:Programfiles\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\PackageManagement\#onegetversion\`

If you are running within PowerShellCore,
similarily drop the PackageManagement folder to your `$env:Programfiles\PowerShell\#psversion\Modules\PackageManagement\#onegetversion\`,

or copy to `/opt/microsoft/powershell/<psversion>/Modules/PackageManagement/#onegetversion/`,
if you are running on Linux or Mac.

**Note**: OneGet version number can be found from the PackageManagement.psd1 file.

### Testing the code
```PowerShell
> cd oneget
> cd Test
> & '.\run-tests.ps1' fullclr
> & '.\run-tests.ps1' coreclr
```

### Understanding the OneGet code repository

OneGet is under rapid development, so you get to see just how the sausage is being made. I try to keep the master branch clean and buildable, but my own working branch can get pretty damn wild and I make no bones about some of this. I work fast, I make big changes, and I try to keep my eye on the target.

Feel free to clone the repository and check out the different branches:

#### Branches

There are currently three branches in the git repository:

| Branch/Tag | Purpose |
| ------- | ---------------------------|
|`master`|  The `master` branch is where the daily builds of OneGet will be made from.  |
|`WMF5_RTM`|  The `WMF5_RTM` tag is to mark the WMF 5.0 RTM release point. |
|`TP5`|  The `TP5` tag is to mark the TP5 release point. |
|`wip`|  The `wip` branch is where the current **unstable** and **not-likely-working** coding is taking place. This lets you see where I'm at before stuff actually hits the master branch. Fun to read, but really, the wild-west of code branches. |
