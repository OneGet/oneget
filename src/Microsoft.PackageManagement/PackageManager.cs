    ///     The public interface to accessing the fetaures of the Package Management Service
    ///     This offers two possible methods to get the instance of the PackageManagementService.
    ///     If the Host is consuming the PackageManagementService by linking to this assembly, then
    ///     the simplest access is just to use the <code>Instance</code> method.
    ///     If the Host has dynamically loaded this assembly, then it can request a dynamically-generated
    ///     instance of the PackageManagementService that implements an interface of their own choosing.
    ///     <example><![CDATA[
    ///    // Manually load the assembly
    ///    var asm = Assembly.Load("Microsoft.PackageManagement.Core.dll" )
    ///     // todo: insert reflection-based loading code.
