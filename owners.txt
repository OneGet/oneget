; this is an example owners.txt file which can be added at any level in the repo to indicate owners of a subtree
; this file is used by ownership enforcer to determine reviewers to add to a pull request
; you can add comments using ; as prefix
; introduce each owner in a separate line with his/her alias (not email address)
; prefixing an alias with * means that the owner will not be automatically added as a reviewer to pull requests to reduce noise, but can still be manually added and can sign off if necessary
; to learn more you can read https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/WAG/EngSys/EngPipeline/cdp/SitePages/Configure%20checkin%20gates.aspx
; if you do not wish to use this feature then you can delete this file
